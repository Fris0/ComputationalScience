1. Methodology
1.1 Hardware and software
The simulations were run on the Arm8v64 architecture. On the system the Sonama 14.2.1 OS is ran.
At last, all experiments on the model were done with Python version 3.10.

1.2 Procedure
To get a broader insight in how Cellular Automatan function, 4 experiments in total were run.

The first 3 experiments all had different spatial size, and besides that the same parameters.
For this the simulate.py was used, and the width parameters was changed manually.

The last experiment used the random parameter on true to figure out if different starting states
affect the average run cycles compared to one without the random parameter set to true.
This experiment was done running the simulate_random.py.

All four experiments store the data in given .csv files names. The data is then used
for further analysis.

1.3 Analysis

For our anaylisis three figures were made. One to show the average cycle difference with different widths,
the second one to show different average cycle lengths between random set to true and off, and a last bar plot
to see if the width or randomness parameters affect the amount of rules without cycle.

avg_cycles_width.png:
In the figure avg_cycles_width the avarage cycles length size increase when the width increases.

avg_cycles_random.png:
The figure shows that turning on the random parameter to true results in a higher maximum average cycle size compared
to when it is turned off. Also, it shows that turning on the random starting state can lead to higher or lower
avarage cycle sizes per rule.

error_plot.png:
Shows that the smaller the width has more rules with cycles found in them, then when a greater spatial size is used.
Also, turning on the random parameter shows more rules with cycles. 


2. Discussion and Conclusion
The analysis of the three figures reveals key insights into the behavior of cellular automata models.
In avg_cycles_width.png, average cycle length increases with width.
Avg_cycles_random.png shows that enabling randomness results in higher maximum average cycle sizes and varied cycle lengths per rule.
Finally, error_plot.png indicates that smaller widths and the presence of randomness lead to a greater number of rules containing cycles, 
emphasizing the significance of parameter choices in cellular automata dynamics.
